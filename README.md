FEMuS
======

Welcome to the FEMuS project! FEMuS is an open-source Finite Element C++ library 
built on top of PETSc, which allows scientists to build and solve multiphysics 
problems with multigrid and domain decomposition techniques.

Setup
=====


Clone the FEMuS source code from the github repository:


    git clone https://github.com/FeMTTU/femus.git

   
You need PETSc for FEMuS to work.
If PETSc is not already installed in your machine, the script "install_petsc.sh" in contrib/scripts/ will install it automatically,
with the following syntax:
  
    ./femus/contrib/scripts/install_petsc.sh --prefix-external my_dir 
  

where "my_dir" is the directory, either absolute or relative, in which you want PETSc to be installed 
(please put it outside of the femus repo directory, to prevent from potential git tracking).

 Source the "configure_femus.sh" script and execute the function "fm_set_femus" in order to set some environment variables:

    source femus/contrib/scripts/configure_femus.sh

    fm_set_femus  --prefix-external my_dir --method-petsc opt
   

  Create the build directory, cd to it and run cmake:
   
    mkdir femus.build

    cd femus.build

    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="[Debug Release RelWithDebInfo MinSizeRel None]"  ../femus
