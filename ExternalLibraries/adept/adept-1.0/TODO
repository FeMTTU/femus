To support large codes better, provide a memory model that does not
require the statement and operation stacks to present as a single
block of memory, but allow them to be partioned into many smaller
blocks.

Complex number support.

Support for mixed precision, e.g. rather than adouble, use
active<double> and active<float>.

Interface to a matrix/vector library that uses expression templates.

Full support for mathematical functions:

Higher-order differentiation, in particular to compute the Hessian
matrix.

Parallelization, both via OpenMP and CUDA (in progress).
