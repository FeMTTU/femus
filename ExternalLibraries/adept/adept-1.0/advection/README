This directory contains the code to run benchmarks for the
Lax-Wendroff and Toon advection schemes described in the Adept
paper. Type "make" to compile the program
run_advection_benchmark_reduced, which includes only the hand-coded
adjoint and the Adept automatic differentiation version.

If you also have ADOL-C, Sacado and CppAD installed, try typing "make
all", although you will probably need to edit the Makefile to ensure
the include and library directories are correctly specified for your
system.

To see the usage instructions, type
"./run_advection_benchmark_reduced" or "./run_advection_benchmark" to
get

Usage: ./run_advection_benchmark_reduced SCHEME [NUM_TIMESTEPS [NUM_REPEATS [COURANT_NUMBER [jacobian]]]]
  where SCHEME is either "lax_wendroff" or "toon"
        NUM_TIMESTEPS has default value 100                    
        NUM_REPEATS has default value 100
        COURANT_NUMBER has default value 0.125

The scripts "benchmark.sh" and "benchmark_reduced.sh" run the two
advection schemes with the various automatic differentiation tools so
that their performance can be compared. The important output goes to
standard output so can be easily redirected to a file.

WARNING: these scripts take a long time to run!  You might want to
edit them and change the number of repeates "NR" to a (much) smaller
number than 1000.
