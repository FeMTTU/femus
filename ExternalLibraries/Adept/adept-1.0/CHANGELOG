	- Very many internal changes and added features
	- Detailed documentation in the doc/ directory

	- For users of version 0.9, the main change to the interface is that the Stack::start() member function is no longer supported; rather you should call the Stack::new_recording() member function *after* the independent variables have been initialized but *before* any mathematical operations are performed using them

version 0.9:
	- First public release
