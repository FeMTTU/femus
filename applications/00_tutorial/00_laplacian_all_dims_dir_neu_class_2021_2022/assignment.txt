 
Solve the Poisson problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the domains given below. 
 If your domain is 2-dimensional, generate 1 mesh made of triangles and 1 mesh made of quadrilaterals.
 If your domain is 3-dimensional, Generate 1 mesh made of tetrahedra and 1 mesh made of hexahedra.
Parametrize your mesh files using the Notebook. 
Save both the Python script and the Study file from Salome.
Export the mesh files in MED format for them to be read in Femus.
Construct an analytical solution to the problem with the Method of Manufactured Solutions.


 The domains are:
 
 Gayani:   circle of radius 1
 Himali:   semi-circle of radius 1
 Max:      quarter of circle of radius 1
 Jonathon: annulus of inner radius 0.5 and outer radius 1
 Fahad:    semi-annulus of inner radius 0.5 and outer radius 1
 Aman:     cylinder of base radius 1 and length 2
 Rifat:    semi-cylinder of base radius 1 and length 2
 Armando:  quarter of cylinder of base radius 1 and length 2
 Abu:      prism with annular base, with inner radius 0.5, outer radius 1 and length 2

 Edward:   quarter of annulus of inner radius 0.5 and outer radius 1 (did not attend)
