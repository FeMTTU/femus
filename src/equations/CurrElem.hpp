// Ok, in this case if we want to reach all the other classes we just 
// use the eq pointer, through which we have the eqn map, through which 
// we have everything...
//Through an equation we get to the equationsmap which gives us access to everything we need
//Ok, I need to pass the Equation, and also I will pass the ref to EqMap, 
// which is protected in the EqnBase class and I want to leave it protected

//The geometry does not depend on the specific equation
//The rest yes

// CurrentElement and CurrentGaussPoint are supposed to be "External containers"
// to hold the informations needed for those objects

//Since we structured the GenMatRhs in terms of VB, then the current elem and gauss point
//are going to have all the VB structure... maybe we could do an object for only VV
// and one for only BB, maybe templatized. So far we go ahead like this.

//here there should be two pointers:
// to the ABSTRACT GEometrical Element
// and to the ABSTRACT FE Element

//Basically earlier we were using the Mesh and the Equation to handle what was needed by the current element.
//Now we are using the current element and current gauss to call from the big classess,
// Mesh and Equation, what is needed for the assemblying

 //alright, here I need a Current Element, to perform the loop
 //the current element only needs the eqn map, so we can use it everywhere
 //TODO here we only need the GEOMETRIC PART of the CurrElem, so maybe we will split 
 //between the CurrGeomEl and the CurrFEEl
//in fact this is used for many element loop, but just to retrieve the geometrical properties
//like coords, middle point, etc.

//Ok, so far we have VB, so if we want only BB or VV we should actually make a vector 
// of two functions like this
//TODO i should TEMPLATIZE over VB!!! YES IT IS TRUE, IN FACT BASICALLY EVERYTHING 
//DEPENDS ON VB, and when you use one you dont use the other!!!

//=======================
//ok here we would need a "REFERENCE REAL ELEMENT"
//the current element contains the absolute coordinates, 
//but not in the reference frame
//ok now i want to set the element center but NOT BASED ON THE MESH

//So, so far we have the CurrElem class is 
//split into a CURR GEOMETRIC and a CURR EQUATION part.
//The curr geometric is basically filled with the MESH class
//The curr fe is basically filled with the EQUATION class

//can we make a currelem that is not based on the mesh?
//Let us now just make this one
