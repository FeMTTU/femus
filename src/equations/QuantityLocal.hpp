// The main difference to consider is  Vect WITH    Quantity
//                                 and Vect WITHOUT Quantity 
// Once you have the Quantity, everything else comes from that association 
////////////////
 //we've seen that these things stay close to each other

 //in every equation there may be Vect with associated quantity or not.
 //So not necessarily you need to define a quantity to associate,
 //but it may be very helpful
 
 //*********
 // every Vect MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A QUANTITY
 // A QUANTITY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AN EQUATION
 // IF A QUANTITY DOES NOT HAVE AN EQUATION, THEN IT MUST HAVE A FUNCTION
 
 //Since the Vect may or may not have a Quantity, 
 //I don't pass the quantity to the constructor, but later
 
 //Ok, so Vect can have a quantity with equation,
 //or a quantity without equation,
 //or no quantity at all
