//What does the Quantity need? 
//The Physics? Yes, for the ref values, and so on
//The Mesh? Yes,through the physics
//The FE values?No
//The Equation pointers? Yes. For every quantity i'll have to say
//what is the equation that computes them, if there is one.
//I'll pass the equation pointer not directly to the constructor,
//but after I have the corresponding equation: set_eqn() or sthg

//If there is an equation, i'll put it; otherwise, i'll put NULL
//If this physical quantity is not considered at all for my simulation,
//then I won't have to instantiate it at all
//In the same way, if an equation is not considered, then you dont even
//instantiate it
//that is why you put things within TEMP_QTY and so on
//Clearly, the quantities that are relevant are dependent 
//of the EQUATIONS
//So, since you have b_hom and Bext, you decide to define two separate
//quantities MagFieldHom and MagFieldExt, because each of the two is 
//naturally attached to a different equation.
//For Pressure, for instance, one may have either NS equation,
//or pressure single projection equation.
//What you only have to change is the GetElDofs() function:
//if you pick from the pressure equation you pick the dofs at some point,
//if you pick from the NS equation you pick the dofs in another point.
//Basically what changes is the DofMap! So, taken one equation,
//the GetElDof function will have to be able of picking 
//either the QUADRATIC or the LINEAR variable.
//For now, we cannot pick only one component, but we can pick
//either ALL the QUADRATIC, or ALL the LINEAR components
//so, the GetElDofs is a function belonging to a specific EQUATION;
//so, we can make it VIRTUAL, so that every Eqn will have its own way
//of implementing it.

//=============================================================
//this function is the wrapper for computing the dofs via a function
 //this works either with LINEAR or with QUADRATIC variables, 
//   but always with a QUADRATIC mesh
///set the external magnetic field on the node 'eln' for the component 'ivarq'
///for every node you get the three dofs
///We can distinguish this in three parts:
/// picking the COORDINATES of the NODES corresponding to the dofs
/// converting the COORDINATES to the reference frame
/// looping over the dofs
///the only part that is not common is providing the THREE COMPONENTS
//this function is appropriate only for the case of a BOX DOMAIN
  //How can I neglect it in the other cases? Just set to zero and that's it, for now...
  //I would prefer avoiding excluding code with #ifdefs, but always compile it
//this function could be a WRAPPER IDENTICAL to ALL THE OTHER WRAPPERS:
//just get the node 'nondimensionalized' coordinates and pass them to the b_txyz function
//the first one is GENERAL
//the second one is SPECIFIC of the physics.
