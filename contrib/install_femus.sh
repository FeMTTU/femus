# Now I'll do like this. this script must be copied in the main femus directory 
# and completed with the machine dependent stuff. then it must be run.
# first of all it creates the folder ExternalLibraries which will be NOT TRACKED using .gitignore!!!

#problemi di questo script: se si interrompe non basta rigirarlo
# non basta che il file sia corrotto


#qual e' la cosa piu' importante? 
# E' fare in modo che TUTTI GLI ESEGUIBILI E LE LIBRERIE CHE SERVONO,
# in particolare MPI e PETSC, siano SEMPRE ACCESSIBILI,
# sia in fase di INSTALLAZIONE
# sia in fase di UTILIZZO!

# Vorrei fare questo in modo che MPI e PETSC siano utilizzabili
# SIA DA SOLI, SIA IN FUNZIONE DI ALTRE LIBRERIE come LA NOSTRA, LIBMESH, AND SO ON

# Ora, la questione e' che l'installazione di PETSC per FEMTTU e' DIVERSA 
# dall'installazione per FEMUS... pertanto, la configurazione per FEMTTU sara' diversa 
# dalla configurazione per FEMUS... 
# bisognerebbe fare un if sul CODICE anziche' sulla macchina...

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FM_HDF5_DIR_ABS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# now, it seems like petsc does not find the libz which is automatically brought inside by hdf5... so let me set the library path for that
# the alternative is to download hdf5 but to put it OUTSIDE of petsc
# CHIARO CI VOGLIONO ANCHE GLI INCLUDE!!! E questi il pacchetto hdf5 NON CE LI HA!!! Quindi bisogna per forza prendere il pacchetto zlib da sistema o scaricarlo!!!
# Prendiamolo da sistema per ora

# HDF5 also needs sz... who is providing it? 
# Since HDF5 may need SZIP and ZLIB, i don't understand why they only put the PRECOMPILED LIBRARIES in the package WITHOUT the INCLUDE FILES...
# Well, if an application using HDF5 will not use those libraries DIRECTLY, then you don't need the includes but only the libs
# So... i have to do LD_LIBRARY_PATH to  let petsc reach libsz... now the only thing is that, doing this, i have TWO LIBZ, one from the system and one from hdf5.
# This may create a little conflict because if the SYSTEM LIBZ has the priority wrt the hdf5 package, then we link against a library which is not exactly
# the one with which hdf5 was compiled and linked... in this sense the most accurate solution would be to COMPILE HDF5... so far let us do with LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# The one thing i dont understand is why the petsc configure script DOES NOT FIND libz.so from the hdf5 lib folder. It should find it,
# because i added it in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH... WHY DOES IT NOT FIND IT?

# You need to set PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH  with the new MPI I think... at least PATH,
# otherwise where are the compilers?!?
# well, what you need to do is for sure to let petsc know about YOUR openmpi and YOUR HDF5...
# then i think that he will automatically find mpic++
# then, another point will be to let MY CODE be aware of MPI and HDF5,
# so I may need PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH for that

#plus, if what i download with petsc may be needed by future "higher level" packages i may consider installing them
# in a different folder than INSIDE petsc, for instance metis or parmetis, but we'll see next...

# Ok, the libraries are specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
#     the binaries are specified in PATH,
# but how do I specify the INCLUDES?!?
# they must be specified in the COMPILING COMMAND IN THE MAKEFILE
# I think that if i installed hdf5 with petsc, i would not have any problem

echo Download, extract, compile LIBMESH

# What we should do now.
# we should download libmesh with git
# then run the configure. Then tell to put libmesh in a different build directory
# in any case, some (a few of the files not in the build directory will be MODIFIED.
# First we make a commit. Then the next idea is to apply a PATCH to libmesh. 
# After I apply the patch I can start the configuration and so on.
# Now my only question is this: if i apply the patch to v.0.9, will i be able to apply it to v1.0, or future versions?
# That's a key thing. Let me see.

# Ora dovremo fare due installazioni di libmesh separate per le due versioni di petsc

# What to do to prepare a libmesh installation
# It's assumed that mpi and petsc (and what petsc needs... hdf5?!) are properly installed,
# So we only need to setup the environment for them

# Now, the question is: basically  libmesh needs for me mpi and petsc.
# Now petsc was installed with several optional libraries, among which hdf5.
# Now when i compile libmesh i get an error involving hdf5...
# Then I have to tell libmesh that hdf5 is there, i think...

# Now, the alternatives when you install libmesh in the configure script are:
# Tell libmesh directly with --with-thelibraryiwant-dir=,
# or modify PATH and   LD_LIBRARY_PATH...
# The best thing is always to use the options of the configure script...
# Plus, I don't want to use hdf5 with libmesh

############### TO INSTALL GAMBIT ##################
# You need to run the script, install openmotif22-libs (libXm.so.3)  # crappy alternative: ln -s libXm.so.4 libXm.so.3, WHICH DOES NOT WORK
# also, you have to install libstdc++33 (libstdc++.so.5)
# After that you have to put the license in the correct place
# Then it works


################# TO INSTALL FEMTTU #################
# git clone "library"

# git clone "each application"

# !!! Download from the libmesh git repository,
