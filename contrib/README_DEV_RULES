RULES FOR DEVELOPING FEMUS

- Use std::cout, do not use printf for output.

- If a function must be performed by only one processor (processor 0),
then write an ifproc INSIDE the FUNCTION.

- Divide the includes in 
FEMuS includes,
 C++ includes,
 other external libraries' includes.

- Always put include guards in header files.

- Write the function names with CapitalLettersLikeThisAndNotWithUnderscores.

- Try to put the includes EXPLICITLY WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE, 
  and not thinking that somewhere some include will lead me to the file i need...

- In the SCRIPTS and in the MAKEFILES, almost all the variables have a FM_ or FEMUS_ prefix.
 The variables without this prefix are like this because 
 they are defined for external packages
 For instance, PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are used to COMPILE PETSC.
 
 - when you create a NEW HEADER, make sure you change the INCLUDE GUARD.
 Then, make sure you add the new files to git.
 
 - when you change the name of a file, header or source, recompile all the applications
   and make sure that everything compiles correctly.
