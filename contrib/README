###### APPLICATION ###########
##############################

###### How to set the parameters for an application ###########
- See the files in the config/ directory

###### How to change the mesh file of an application ###########
- Put the mesh file in the config/ directory 
- Set the filename in the femus_conf.in file
- Set libmesh_gen to 0

###### IF YOU WANT TO REVERT TO LIBMESH GENERATED MESH ###########
- Set libmesh_gen back to 1
- Don't have to move any mesh file

####### How to schedule a suite of runs ##########
- Folders with time files

####### How to switch from one application to another ##########
- Just change folder. 

####### How to create a new application ##########
- Copy the structure of an existing application, in particular the directories
   and the configuration files
- Define your own Equations, Quantities and Physics based on the BASE CLASSES provided with the library.   
- Instantiate in the main one object of each of the following types:
  <Gencase>, <Box>, <TimeLoop>, <Utils>, <Files>, <Physics>
  (notice, these are the names of the TYPES, not of the instantiations...
   suppose you want to have more than one instantiation, then you should give DIFFERENT TAGS 
   for each separate instantiation...)
   We should define for each type if they need a RuntimeMap and what parameters they need in it...
   Yeah, in the constructor of such an object we must put the check "if the file isn't there, abort"
