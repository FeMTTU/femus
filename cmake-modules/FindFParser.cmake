# - Find the Function Parser for C++ library
# This C++ library offers a class which can be used to parse and evaluate a mathematical function 
# from a string (which might be eg. requested from the user). The syntax of the function string is 
# similar to mathematical expressions written in C/C++.
# The function can then be evaluated with different values of variables.
# For example, a function like "sin(sqrt(x*x+y*y))" can be parsed from a string 
# (either std::string or a C-style string) and then evaluated with different values of x and y. 
# This library can be useful for evaluating user-inputted functions, or in some cases 
# interpreting mathematical expressions in a scripting language.
# This library aims for maximum speed in both parsing and evaluation, while keeping maximum portability. 
# The library should compile and work with any standard-conforming C++ compiler.
# Different numerical types are supported: double, float, long double, long int, 
# std::complex (of types double, float and long double), multiple-precision floating point 
# numbers using the MPFR library, and arbitrary precision integers using the GMP library. 
# (Note that it's not necessary for these two libraries to exist in the system in order 
# to use the Function Parser library with the other numerical types. 
# Support for these libraries is optionally compiled in using preprocessor settings.)
