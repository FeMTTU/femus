//the advantage of adding a namespace is that you dont have to INSTANTIATE OBJECTS.
//So, if you need to pass data or functions to some class, you dont have to INSTANTIATE an EXTERNAL object
//containing those data or those functions and then PASS that EXTERNAL OBJECT to the target object:
//those data and functions are like GLOBAL, you can pass them just with an include

// TODO this class should be with a map of STRINGS which then are turned into DOUBLES or INTEGERS according to the NEEDS!!!
// OK I CHANGED IT, it might have comments for the DOUBLES but it is with STRINGS NOW!
// We should make a TEMPLATE CLASS or TEMPLATE FUNCTION

//in this position it is like in a class, namely, a place where i can "drop" (once,or more) and then "drag"
//also, it is as if it were PRIVATE because you cannot access it from other files than this
//=> you necessarily need a get() like for protected data in classes
// how about const attributes for functions? It's only for classes:
// error: non-member function ‘double CmdLine::get(std::string)’ cannot have cv-qualifier
//to protect this datum I could use const... but in that way i couldnt fill it after initialization, so no...
//since this map is in anonymous namespace, it has file scope, so it can be seen only in this file

//what if I do a map of strings and strings and then I transform them into int or double on the basis of what i need?
